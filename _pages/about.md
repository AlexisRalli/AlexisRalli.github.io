Hi, I'm Alexis Ralli a postdoctoral fellow at Tufts University in the [Quantum Information Quantum Computing (QIQC) group](https://sites.google.com/view/tuftsqi).

I completed a quantum chemistry PhD student in the [Centre for Computational Science group (CCS)](https://ccs.chem.ucl.ac.uk/) at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

Currently, my work focuses on applications of quantum computing to chemistry. In particular I study different subspace methods and where quantum mechanics truely occurs in these methods. Specifically, I am interested in quantum contextuality. 
 
I earned an MChem in chemistry from the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), followed by an MRes in quantum technology from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/quantum/people).

Projects
======
Along with my colleague [Tim Weaving](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sz4S2-gAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), we are building an open-source python package called [Symmer](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/symmer) that allows people to study quantum problems using subspace methods. We welcome users to try it out!  This project has been supported by a grant from the [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund/)
