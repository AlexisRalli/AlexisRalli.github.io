excerpt: 'Quantum chemistry is a promising application fornoisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However,quantum computers have thus far not succeeded in providingsolutions to problems of real scientific significance, withalgorithmic advances being necessary to fully utilize even themodest NISQ machines available today. We discuss a method ofground state energy estimation predicated on a partitioning of themolecular Hamiltonian into two parts: one that is noncontextualand can be solved classically, supplemented by a contextualcomponent that yields quantum corrections obtained via aVariational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) routine. This approachhas been termed Contextual Subspace VQE (CS-VQE); however, there are obstacles to overcome before it can be deployed on NISQ devices. The problem we address here is that of the ansatz, a parametrized quantum state over which we optimize during VQE; it is not initially clear how a splitting of the Hamiltonian should be reflected in the CS-VQE ansätze. We propose a “noncontextual projection” approach that is illuminated by a reformulation of CS-VQE in the stabilizer formalism. This defines an ansatz restriction from the full electronic structure problem to the contextual subspace and facilitates an implementation of CS-VQE that may be deployed on NISQ devices. We validate the noncontextual projection ansatz using a quantum simulator and demonstrate chemically precise ground state energy calculations for a suite of small molecules at a significant reduction in the required qubit count and circuit depth.'
