excerpt: 'The Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) is a technique that provides a unified framework for describing many of the quantum algorithms discovered to date. We implement a noise-free simulation of the technique to investigate how it can be used to perform matrix inversion, which is an important step in calculating the single-particle Green's function in the Lehmann representation. Due to the inverse function not being defined at zero, we explore the effect of approximating f(x)=1/x with a polynomial. This is carried out by calculating the single-particle Green's function of the two-site single-impurity Anderson model. We also propose a new circuit construction for the linear combination of unitaries block encoding technique, that reduces the number of single and two-qubit gates required.'
