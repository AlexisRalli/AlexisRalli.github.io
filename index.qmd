## Bio
Hi, I'm Alexis — cofounder of an early-stage quantum chemistry startup. I'm passionate about using both conventional and quantum computers to simulate molecular systems, with the goal of unlocking new drugs and materials.

Outside of work, I enjoy cycling, watching films, and contributing to open-source projects.

Currently my blog focuses on chemistry and quantum science — from educational content to industry insights — though you'll also find the occasional off-topic post sprinkled in.


## Projects
Along with my friend [Tim Weaving](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sz4S2-gAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), we have developed an open-source python package called [`Symmer`](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/symmer) that allows people to study quantum problems using subspace methods. We welcome users to try it out!  This project has been supported by a grant from the [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund/)

## Background
I completed a quantum chemistry PhD in the [Centre for Computational Science group (CCS)](https://ccs.chem.ucl.ac.uk/) group at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

I was then a postdoctoral fellow at Tufts University in the [Quantum Information Quantum Computing (QIQC) group](https://sites.google.com/view/tuftsqi).
