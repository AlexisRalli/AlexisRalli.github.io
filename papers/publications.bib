    abstract = {We apply Carleman linearization of the Lattice Boltzmann (CLB) representation of fluid flows to quantum emulate the dynamics of a two-dimensional Kolmogorov-like flow. We assess the accuracy of the result and find a relative error of the order of  10âˆ’3 with just two Carleman iterates for a range of the Reynolds number up to a few hundreds. We first define a gate-based quantum circuit for the implementation of the CLB method and then exploit the sparse nature of the CLB matrix to build a quantum circuit based on block-encoding techniques which makes use of matrix oracles. It is shown that the gate complexity of the algorithm is thereby dramatically reduced, from exponential to quadratic. However, due to the need of employing up to seven ancilla qubits, the probability of success of the corresponding circuit for a single time step is too low to enable multi-step time evolution. Several possible directions to circumvent this problem are briefly outlined.},

journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
abstract = {Contextuality is a key feature of quantum mechanics, and identification of noncontextual subtheories of quantum mechanics is of both fundamental and practical importance. Recently, noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians have been defined in the setting of variational quantum algorithms. In this work we rigorously establish a number of properties of noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians. We prove that these Hamiltonians can be composed of more Pauli operators than diagonal Hamiltonians. This establishes that noncontextual Hamiltonians are able to describe a greater number of physical interactions. We then show that the eigenspaces admit an efficient classical description. We analyze the eigenspace of these Hamiltonians and prove that for every eigenvalue there exists an associated eigenvector whose stabilizer rank scales linearly with the number of qubits. We prove that further structure in these Hamiltonians allow us to derive where degeneracies in the eigenspectrum can arise. We thus open the field to a new class of efficiently simulatable states.}
